# Link Project to Repository - Manual Steps

## Overview
Since GitHub CLI doesn't support linking repositories to projects directly, you'll need to do this manually through the GitHub web interface.

## Steps to Link Project to Repository

### 1. Access the Project Board
- Go to: https://github.com/users/Poomathi-Kaavian/projects/2
- Project Name: "TODO App Development Tasks"

### 2. Link Repository to Project
1. **Click on Project Settings** (gear icon in the top right)
2. **Go to "Repositories" section**
3. **Click "Add repository"**
4. **Search for**: `Poomathi-Kaavian/todo-app`
5. **Select the repository** and click "Add"

### 3. Verify the Link
- The repository should now appear in the project's repository list
- This will allow the project to:
  - Track issues and pull requests from the repository
  - Show repository-specific information in project items
  - Enable better integration between the project and code

### 4. Benefits of Linking
Once linked, the project will have:
- **Repository field** in project items
- **Automatic issue/PR tracking** from the linked repository
- **Better integration** with the codebase
- **Repository-specific views** and filters

## Alternative: Using GitHub Web Interface

### Method 1: From Repository Side
1. Go to: https://github.com/Poomathi-Kaavian/todo-app
2. Click on "Projects" tab
3. Click "Link a project"
4. Select "TODO App Development Tasks" project
5. Click "Link project"

### Method 2: From Project Side
1. Go to: https://github.com/users/Poomathi-Kaavian/projects/2
2. Click project settings (gear icon)
3. Go to "Repositories" section
4. Click "Add repository"
5. Search and select "Poomathi-Kaavian/todo-app"

## Verification
After linking, you should see:
- Repository name in project settings
- Repository field available in project items
- Better integration between project and code

## Next Steps
Once the repository is linked:
1. Add the tasks as project items (as described in PROJECT_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. Team members can start working on their assigned tasks
3. Use the project board for tracking progress
4. Link issues and pull requests to project items as work progresses
